                        I am pursuing my Master in Cyber Security at ETH Zürich and EPFL with a specific focus on network security. For my minor, I selected Visual and Interactive Computing. Cyber security is crucial for protecting digital infrastructure, safeguarding sensitive data, and preventing cyber threats in our increasingly connected world.

                    <p>
                        I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Univerity of Technology in Graz. During my time in Graz, I established a strong foundation in both programming and mathematics. My thesis titled "Universal Biometric Authentication" evaluates various possibilities to include biometric authentication on the desktop and the web. We implemented a FIDO2-based prototype that enables clients to log into web services using Android devices as an authentication token. During my studies I briefly joined the LosFuzzys, a CTF team who regularly competes at worldwide CTF competitions.

                <h3>Detecting Proxy Servers Based On Their Network Traffic</h3>
                <h4>Patrick Louis Aldover, Roland Meier, Adrian Perrig</h4>
                <h5>Conference: TBA</h5>
                <p>
                    If Internet users do not want to reveal their identity (especially their public IP address) to a contacted server, they can use a proxy server. Proxy servers (or proxies) relay requests and responses between their clients and the contacted servers such that the proxy appears as the source of the requests, and therefore clients are not visible to the servers.</p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, malicious clients utilize proxies to perform various attacks, such as DDoS attacks and fraudulent activities, while concealing their identity. Additionally, rotating IP proxies and the recent introduction of residential IP proxies complicate the detection even further. Therefore, our goal for this project is to detect proxy servers based on their network traffic. Based on previous work that shows that it is, in principle, possible to identify proxy servers based on timing information extracted from network traffic, we develop and evaluate a system that can apply this technique in large networks. Our results show that we achieve a mean F1 score of over 90% after 250 requests. The proxy detection system requires a minimum distance of 650 km between clients and forward proxies to classify them precisely. Varying the client's bandwidth has an evident impact on the detection accuracy, whereas the client's latency has barely an influence.
